    <p><strong>New to Prince George or just craving a low-effort walk with big vibes?</strong> Here are five easy trails locals love‚Äîzero gatekeeping, just the good stuff. Each pick works for a chill evening stroll, a weekend reset, or a no-sweat intro to PG‚Äôs outdoors.</p>

    <p class="mt-6">Heads-up: conditions change with weather and seasons. Pack water, tell someone where you‚Äôre going, and give wildlife space. üêª</p>

    <h2 id="cottonwood" class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold"> 1) Cottonwood Island Nature Park (2.2 km, flat) <div class="blog-media">

</div> </h2>
    
    <p>Riverside, mellow, and photogenic. This is the downtown-adjacent walk for ‚ÄúI just want some air.‚Äù Look for the hidden tree-carvings and the views where the Nechako meets the Fraser. Great for families and visitors, and it pairs perfectly with a coffee downtown.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li><em>Distance & grade:</em> ~2.2 km loop, under 10 m elevation‚Äîvery flat.</li>
      <li><em>Best for:</em> after-work walks, first-time visitors, easy photo ops.</li>
      <li><em>Parking:</em> Park by the railway bridge access or the main lot; follow the signed loop.</li>
      <li><em>Internal picks:</em> After your walk, explore our <a href="/#gems">Gem Cards</a>. Locals love pairing this trail with nearby caf√©s‚Äî<a href="/#gems-cafes">see our caf√© picks</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold"> 2) Forests for the World ‚Äì Shane Lake Loop (easy, choose your length) <div class="blog-media"><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2351.0338228431883!2d-122.83445752333019!3d53.895602772453756!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x53889bc1a3a3261d%3A0xaf80406ed49fafc!2sForests%20for%20the%20World!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1757196378558!5m2!1sen!2sca" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
    </div> </h2>
    <p>The city‚Äôs classic green escape. Well-signed paths weave through mixed forest to Shane Lake, and you can keep it short or extend as your energy allows. Benches, birds, and plenty of shade in summer.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li><em>Route vibe:</em> gentle grades; you choose short lake loops or longer connectors.</li>
      <li><em>Best for:</em> beginners who still want that ‚ÄúI was really in the woods‚Äù feeling.</li>
      <li><em>Parking:</em> Multiple access points; the Shane Lake lot is the simplest.</li>
      <li><em>Pro tip:</em> Bring a small snack, sit at the lake, and let time slow down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">3) Moore‚Äôs Meadow Nature Park (easy network; do 3‚Äì4 km loops)<div class="blog-media"> <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d13286.107819162306!2d-122.82176920861606!3d53.93753118866907!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x538899b8e4b7f197%3A0x2a86d7ab2b692eb5!2sMoore&#39;s%20Meadow%20Nature%20Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1757196826745!5m2!1sen!2sca" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
    </div></h2>
    <p>Think wide, soft paths and a tucked-away meadow vibe inside the city. You can walk a relaxed inner loop or explore further‚Äîlocals often do 30‚Äì60 minutes and call it a day. Dog-friendly zones exist; check signage.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li><em>Network:</em> Multiple loop options (the full network is quite long, but most people do 3‚Äì4 km).</li>
      <li><em>Best for:</em> dog-walks, low-effort cardio, ‚Äútalk-walks‚Äù with a friend.</li>
      <li><em>Access:</em> Several entrances; Foothills side is common.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">4) Hudson‚Äôs Bay Wetland Nature Park (‚âà1.8 km boardwalks & viewpoints)<div class="blog-media"><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d9403.325255021637!2d-122.74392339311619!3d53.899202109069805!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x5388990054429735%3A0x931fb21292520f4d!2sHudson%20Bay%20Wetland%20Nature%20Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1757197004508!5m2!1sen!2sca" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe></div></h2>
    <p>Birdsong, water views, and interpretive signs just minutes from downtown. Short, scenic, and snackable‚Äîyou‚Äôll be surprised how fast you feel away from the city. Observation platforms make this great for kids and new arrivals.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li><em>Length:</em> about 1.8 km of trail; expect short rises and weather-dependent footing.</li>
      <li><em>Best for:</em> nature-spotting with minimal effort; sunrise/sunset strolls.</li>
      <li><em>Bonus:</em> Combine with Lheidli T‚Äôenneh Memorial Park time afterwards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">5) Ferguson Lake Nature Reserve (‚âà3.5 km loop, mostly flat)<div class="blog-media"><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d53057.934301994035!2d-122.82148935039385!3d54.00541012470878!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x538897007d58274b%3A0x123850ec5579c7e!2sFerguson%20Lake%20Nature%20Preserve!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1757197083539!5m2!1sen!2sca" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe></div></h2>
    <p>Boardwalks, quiet water, and a loop that just feels good. A favorite ‚Äúreset‚Äù walk for locals when you want the calm of a small lake without the drive.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li><em>Distance:</em> roughly 3.5 km loop; allow ~1 hour if you‚Äôre strolling.</li>
      <li><em>Best for:</em> peaceful loops, birdwatching, and all-levels outings.</li>
      <li><em>Look for:</em> historical homesteader remnants along parts of the loop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">Bonus if you want a tiny challenge</h3>
    <p><strong>L.C. Gunn Park</strong> gives you Fraser River viewpoints along bluff-top singletrack. It‚Äôs rated more ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù (some steeper sections and roots), but still a short urban adventure. Save this for when you‚Äôre feeling a bit spicy.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">When to go & local etiquette</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li><em>Best months:</em> Spring‚Äìfall are the easiest. Winter is gorgeous but use traction if it‚Äôs icy.</li>
      <li><em>Wildlife:</em> This is BC‚Äîbe bear-aware, keep dogs controlled, and give moose and cubs space.</li>
      <li><em>Leave No Trace:</em> Stay on trails, pack out snacks, and skip feeding wildlife.</li>
    </ul>

    // === Free Things to Do in Prince George (new post) ===
    const FREE_POST_SLUG = "free-things-to-do-in-prince-george";
    const FREE_POST_HTML = `
    <figure class="my-4">
  <img src="/og-hero.jpg" alt="Prince George riverside trail and skyline" style="width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:12px;">
  <figcaption style="font-size:14px;color:#64748b;margin-top:.5rem;">A free day starts here ‚Äî river, trails, and a plan.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Prince George proves a simple truth: <strong>you don‚Äôt need a big budget to feel alive</strong>. Between river-cut trails, community art, and seasonal festivals, the city rewards curiosity. This is a local-first guide with <strong>practical picks you can do today</strong>, even on a quick lunch break. And yes ‚Äî <strong>it‚Äôs all free</strong>.</p>

<h2>1) LC Gunn Park Trails (ridges, river, city views)</h2>
<p>A narrow ridge trail that tracks the Fraser River with <strong>calming forest on one side and PG‚Äôs skyline on the other</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Personal note:</em> Walking LC Gunn, you catch a <strong>clean view across to Lheidli T‚Äôenneh Memorial Park and downtown</strong> ‚Äî it‚Äôs one of those places where the city and river feel like a single frame.</p>
<p class="text-sm text-slate-500">Trail is narrow in spots with side slopes; watch footing if it‚Äôs wet or icy.</p>


<h2>2) Cottonwood Island Nature Park (tree carvings, <em>and</em> Roxy the rock snake)</h2>
<p>Follow the river and <strong>scan the carved cottonwoods</strong> ‚Äî faces, animals, patterns cut into the trunks. It‚Äôs playful, reflective, and <strong>strangely grounding</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Personal note:</em> On recent walks I‚Äôve started ‚Äúchecking in‚Äù on <strong>Roxy the rock snake</strong> ‚Äî a community-built line of painted rocks that keeps growing along the path. It‚Äôs simple and wholesome: kids add a few stones, someone paints eyes on a new ‚Äúhead,‚Äù and the whole thing becomes a living marker of how many small moments pass through this park.</p>
<p class="text-sm text-slate-500">Roxy is a community project at Cottonwood that locals keep adding to; it‚Äôs even inspired decals and community fundraisers over time. </p>

<h2>3) Lheidli T‚Äôenneh Memorial Park (big green heart of PG)</h2>
<p>Picnic lawns, riverbank seats, casual strolls ‚Äî <strong>this is where PG breathes</strong>. On event days, it turns into a community magnet; on quiet days, it‚Äôs just <strong>you, trees, and wind</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Do this:</strong> Park near the bandshell, walk the river edge for 10 minutes, then sit and do nothing for two. You‚Äôll actually hear the city exhale.</p>


<h2>4) Connaught Hill Park (panoramic overlook)</h2>
<p>Drive or walk up and get <strong>a 360¬∞ sense of the city</strong>: roads, rooftops, rivers. It‚Äôs the kind of view that makes you re-choose the rest of your day.</p>
<p><strong>Golden-hour tip:</strong> If you‚Äôre after a quick city photo, this is the ‚Äúno setup, instant result‚Äù spot. Sunrise is calmer; sunset is warmer.</p>


<h2>5) Downtown Murals & Street Art (self-guided mini-gallery)</h2>
<p>PG‚Äôs downtown walls are a <strong>free open-air gallery</strong>. Stroll a few blocks and you‚Äôll stack colour, story, and local personality into your afternoon without trying.</p>
<p>Start at 3rd &amp; Quebec and wander two or three blocks each way ‚Äî you‚Äôll catch a rotation of murals and heritage markers. If you‚Äôre in a ‚Äúlearn while you walk‚Äù mood, use a <strong>self-guided heritage tour map</strong> to stitch a loop that blends art with history.</p>
<p class="text-sm text-slate-500">Downtown PG maintains walking resources; the library has heritage walking tour PDFs that pair nicely with the murals. </p>

<h2>6) PG Public Library (focus, curiosity, quiet wins)</h2>
<p>Libraries are still <strong>the best productivity hack</strong>. Grab a corner, deep-read for 25 minutes, or browse local history to see how the city became itself.</p>
<p><strong>Micro-focus ritual:</strong> 25-minute read, 5-minute stretch, repeat once. If you only do this, the day already ‚Äúwon.‚Äù</p>

<h2>7) PG Farmers‚Äô Market (Saturdays ‚Äî browse is free)</h2>
<p>Year-round Saturdays (outdoor in summer, indoor in winter) ‚Äî <strong>8:30am to 2pm</strong> downtown around <strong>3rd Ave &amp; Quebec</strong>. Vendors rotate with the seasons: <strong>local veggies</strong>, <strong>raw honey</strong>, preserves, baked goods, handmade soaps, beadwork, small-batch coffee, and more.</p>
<p><em>Small joy:</em> I like doing one slow lap just to talk to makers, then a second ‚Äúdecide‚Äù lap. On busy summer Saturdays the cluster of markets spills onto nearby blocks, and parts of the street feel like an <strong>open-air promenade</strong> ‚Äî it‚Äôs the best way to <strong>feel downtown</strong> without spending much.</p>
<p class="text-sm text-slate-500">Details: Year-round Saturdays, typically 8:30‚Äì2:00, centered at 3rd Ave &amp; Quebec; check the market‚Äôs own updates for seasonal layouts and street use when the outdoor season is in full swing.</p>


<h2>8) Free Community Festivals (seasonal energy)</h2>
<p>From winter gatherings to summer celebrations, <strong>PG knows how to show up for its own</strong>. Music, food trucks, pop-up stalls ‚Äî the mood alone is worth the trip.</p>

<h2>9) Northern Lights (when the sky says yes)</h2>
<p>On clear, cold nights, a short drive outside light glow can pay off. You might get a faint ribbon or a full curtain ‚Äî either way, it‚Äôs a reminder: <strong>nature still owns the stage</strong>.</p>

<h2>10) Ancient Forest / Chun T‚Äôoh Whudujut (boardwalk through time)</h2>
<p>Old-growth cedars, an elevated boardwalk, and air that feels different. <strong>It‚Äôs a free masterclass in perspective</strong> ‚Äî quiet, massive, and generous. (Check park advisories before you go.)</p>
<p class="text-sm text-slate-500">Accessibility: a <strong>450m Universal Access boardwalk</strong> allows most visitors ‚Äî including wheelchair users ‚Äî to experience the inland temperate rainforest; the full boardwalk is ~2.3 km. </p>
